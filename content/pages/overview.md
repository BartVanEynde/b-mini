## This is what I have
- I have a tags directory inside my data directory
- There I have yaml files for each tag, giving them more info...

## Goal
- What I want is to be able to join them with the hugo tag structure
- if possible site wide. If not, at least on the current page

## Example of a yaml file: test.yml
{{< highlight yaml >}}
