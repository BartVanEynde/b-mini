The layout is borrowed from [W3Schools - How To Create a Fixed Top Menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_menu.asp)

I found the css code for the footer-trick on codepen.io - [CSS “Always on the bottom” Footer](https://codepen.io/cbracco/pen/kQmVGM)

Made responsive with the help of this [CodePen Home
Pure CSS responsive menu](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/MWEJEWG).
