## Q: Can I create a small responsive theme without adding a framework like bootstrap,... ?
 * The layout is borrowed from [W3Schools - How To Create a Fixed Top Menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_menu.asp)
 * I found the css code for the footer-trick on codepen.io - [CSS “Always on the bottom” Footer](https://codepen.io/cbracco/pen/kQmVGM)
 * Made responsive with the help of this: [CodePen - Home Pure CSS responsive menu](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/MWEJEWG).

## A: Sure, you're looking at it... :-)
